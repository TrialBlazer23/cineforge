This is an excellent foundation. You have correctly identified the core needs for a structured AI filmmaking workflow. The biggest challenges in this space are organization, consistency, and moving from script to visual planning.

Let's expand your vision into a comprehensive software suite. We will organize your ideas into distinct modules, deepen the Gemini integration, and add critical features like prompt management, asset versioning, and pre-visualization tools to make it truly essential.

### **Program Overview: KINO-GEIST AI Studio**

**Tagline:** *The Intelligent Studio Hub for Generative Filmmaking.*

**Core Philosophy:** KINO-GEIST is not a media generator. It is the organizational backbone and central nervous system for AI-assisted filmmaking. It provides a unified environment to write, plan, manage, and visualize projects. It utilizes Gemini not just as a writer, but as a persistent, context-aware production assistant that understands the relationship between the script, the world, the assets, and the final vision.

---

### **1\. The Command Center (Main Dashboard)**

The entry point for the project, providing an immediate overview and rapid navigation.

* **Project Snapshot:** A high-level view of project status (e.g., Script Completion %, Shots Storyboarded, Assets Pending Approval).  
* **Quick Navigation:** Immediate access to the Writer's Room, Story Bible, Shot Lab, and Asset Nexus.  
* **Recent Activity Feed:** A live feed showing the latest script revisions, newly imported assets, and collaborator comments.  
* **Universal Gemini Copilot:** A persistent chat interface accessible from any screen for quick queries, brainstorming, or task execution (e.g., "Show me all scenes taking place at the 'Diner' location").

---

### **2\. Module 1: The Writer’s Room (Story & Screenplay)**

A dedicated environment for narrative creation, supercharged by Gemini integration.

* **The Idea Space (Treatment & Brainstorming):** A flexible, rich-text editor for developing the story treatment and outlining.  
  * **Gemini Collaborator:** A dedicated side-panel chat. Users can brainstorm, ask Gemini to generate loglines from simple prompts, suggest plot points, or help overcome writer's block.  
  * **Toolkit & I/O:** Full formatting toolkit, with robust Import (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and Save/Export capabilities, as requested.  
* **The "Gemini Format" Engine (Screenplay Conversion):**  
  * The feature you requested: A button that, when clicked, prompts Gemini to analyze the prose story from the Idea Space and automatically convert it into a professionally formatted screenplay (identifying Action, Character, Dialogue, and Scene Headings).  
* **The Script Studio:** A full-featured, industry-standard screenplay editor.  
  * **AI Polish & Collaboration:** Users can highlight sections and collaborate with Gemini for improvements (e.g., "Punch up this dialogue," "Make this scene description more visual for prompting," or "Check for pacing issues").

---

### **3\. Module 2: The Story Bible (The Lore Keeper)**

A dynamic, living document that ensures narrative consistency across the project.

* **The Overview Matrix:** A main dashboard displaying the core sections: Logline, Synopsis, Character Profiles, Locations/Worldbuilding, Key Props, and Core Themes.  
* **Interactive Deep Dives:** As requested, clicking any section opens a dedicated, tabbed workspace for detailed information, creating a wiki-like experience.  
* **Gemini Auto-Population (The "Analyze & Extract" Feature):**  
  * The key feature you requested: Users direct Gemini to read the current screenplay and automatically populate the Story Bible.  
  * Gemini identifies all characters and locations, infers relationships, and drafts initial profiles based on the script action and dialogue. The user reviews and approves these entries.  
* **Dynamic Linking:** Character names and locations in the Script Studio are automatically hyperlinked to their Story Bible entries for instant reference.

---

### **4\. Module 3: The Consistency Engine (Visual DNA)**

A critical module specifically for generative filmmaking, designed to manage and maintain a cohesive visual style—separate from the narrative bible.

* **Visual Style Guide Hub:** Define the film's overall aesthetic—color palettes, lighting styles (e.g., noir, high-key), cinematic influences, aspect ratio, and desired "lens looks."  
* **Character & Location "DNA Kits":** Centralized visual profiles linked to the Story Bible.  
  * **Anchor Images:** Upload the definitive reference images (generated externally) for a character or location.  
  * **The Prompt Lexicon:** Dedicated fields to store the exact prompts, keywords, negative prompts, seeds, or model references used to generate the Anchor Images. This is the "Visual DNA" that ensures the style can be replicated reliably across different shots and tools.

---

### **5\. Module 4: The Shot Lab (Breakdown & Storyboarding)**

This module bridges the gap between the written word and the visual generation process.

* **Smart Script Breakdown:** The finalized screenplay is displayed side-by-side with a dynamic shot list interface.  
  * **AI Assist:** Gemini can analyze a scene and suggest a preliminary shot list (e.g., Master, OTS, CU) based on the action and dialogue.  
* **Shot Management:** A robust, sortable view to refine the shot list, adding metadata for Shot Type, Angle, Movement, Lens Type, and Status (e.g., Pending Generation, Approved).  
* **The Storyboard Canvas:** The centralized organizational tool you requested.  
  * A dynamic visualization tool where each shot is represented as a card.  
  * **Asset Linking:** Users upload generated still images (from Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, etc.) and drag them directly onto the corresponding shot card.  
  * **Prompt Workbench:** A dedicated area attached to each shot card for crafting and storing prompts. It allows users to easily pull keywords from the Prompt Lexicon (Module 3\) to ensure consistency.

---

### **6\. Module 5: The Asset Nexus (Digital Asset Management)**

A robust system for handling the thousands of assets generated during an AI production.

* **Centralized Library:** A searchable database for all imported media: stills, generated video clips (e.g., RunwayML, Pika Labs outputs), AI voiceovers, and music stems.  
* **AI-Powered Tagging:** Utilizing vision models or metadata analysis to automatically tag the content of uploaded assets (e.g., "Sunset, sci-fi armor, sad expression") and link them to the relevant scene and Story Bible entries.  
* **Versioning Stacks:** Manage multiple iterations of the same generated shot, allowing users to compare versions and select the best option ("Approved") without cluttering the workspace.

---

### **7\. Module 6: The Screening Room (Animatics & Pre-Visualization)**

An essential addition to review the film's pacing and structure before committing to time-consuming video generation.

* **Animatic Timeline:** A simple, non-linear editor (NLE) interface.  
* **Storyboard-to-Timeline Sync:** Automatically assemble the storyboard images from the Shot Lab onto the timeline in the correct sequence.  
* **Audio Integration:** Allows for the import of scratch dialogue, sound effects, and temporary music to build the rhythm of the film.

---

### **8\. Module 7: Export & Pipeline Integration**

KINO-GEIST is designed to hand off the project seamlessly to professional editing and finishing tools.

* **NLE Handoff (The Pipeline):** Exporting the Animatic timeline data via XML or EDL for seamless import into professional editing software (e.g., Adobe Premiere, DaVinci Resolve), with the storyboard assets already linked and timed.  
* **Script/Bible Export:** Export to .FDX (Final Draft), PDF, and DOCX.  
* **Asset Bundle:** Exports a structured folder system containing all approved assets, organized logically by scene and shot number, ready for post-production.
